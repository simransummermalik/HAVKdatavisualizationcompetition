# HAVK Data Visualization Sprint

This repository documents the Data Visualization Sprint I organized and led under HAVK at UNC Charlotte.

The event was designed to simulate a real data science sprint where students from AI, Cybersecurity, Data Science, Biology, and Engineering backgrounds analyzed real datasets under time pressure and presented insights to a judging panel.  
I created the structure, starter notebook, and judging framework to help participants learn how to clean, analyze, and communicate data-driven findings effectively.

## Event Summary

- **Name:** HAVK Data Visualization Sprint  
- **Date:** November 3, 2025  
- **Duration:** 5:30 PM – 9:00 PM  
- **Location:** University of North Carolina at Charlotte  
- **Role:** Organizer and content creator  

Participants were given randomized datasets and had three hours to analyze, visualize, and interpret results using tools of their choice (Python, R, or visualization platforms).  
The event emphasized analytical reasoning, storytelling through data, and the ability to think critically under constraints.
